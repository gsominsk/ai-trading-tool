## Adaptation Strategy for Crypto Trading on Binance

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Adaptation

#### 1.1 Market Data Integration
**Current**: yfinance for stock data
**Adaptation**: 
- Replace with Binance API using `python-binance` library
- Implement real-time WebSocket connections for price feeds
- Add support for 1H timeframe data collection
- Integrate multiple cryptocurrency pairs (up to 100 as per requirements)

#### 1.2 Portfolio Structure Modification
**Current Structure**:
```python
{
    "ticker": "ABEO", 
    "shares": 6, 
    "stop_loss": 4.9, 
    "buy_price": 5.77, 
    "cost_basis": 34.62
}
```

**Crypto Adaptation**:
```python
{
    "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
    "quantity": 0.001,
    "stop_loss": 45000.0,
    "entry_price": 50000.0,
    "cost_basis": 50.0,
    "position_type": "LONG",  # or "SHORT"
    "timeframe": "1h",
    "entry_timestamp": "2025-08-01T22:00:00Z"
}
```

#### 1.3 Risk Management Enhancement
**Additions needed**:
- Position sizing based on volatility (Kelly Criterion implementation)
- Portfolio-wide risk limits (max 2-3% risk per trade)
- Correlation analysis between crypto pairs
- Dynamic stop-loss adjustment based on ATR (Average True Range)

### Phase 2: AI Integration Layer

#### 2.1 Decision Engine Architecture
**Current**: Manual ChatGPT consultation via prompts
**Enhancement**: 
- Automated AI analysis pipeline using:
  - LSTM/RNN models for price prediction
  - Computer vision for chart pattern recognition
  - Natural language processing for sentiment analysis
  - Multi-timeframe analysis (1H primary, 15M for entries, 4H for trends)

#### 2.2 Prompt Engineering for Crypto
**Adapted Base Prompt**:
```
You are a professional cryptocurrency portfolio manager. You have access to real-time data for up to 100 crypto pairs on Binance. Your objective is to generate maximum alpha using 1-hour timeframe strategies. You have complete control over:
- Position sizing (max 2% risk per trade)
- Entry/exit timing
- Stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Portfolio allocation across multiple cryptocurrencies
