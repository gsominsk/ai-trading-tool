TASK 2.4: Mock State Isolation Tests
===================================

PRIORITY: MEDIUM
PHASE: 2 - Testing Architecture Enhancement

PROBLEM CONTEXT:
---------------
Mock state contamination between tests and symbols:
- Shared mock objects retain state across test runs
- UUID counters not reset between tests
- Symbol-specific data bleeding between test cases
- Mock timing sequences not properly isolated

ROOT CAUSE:
----------
Lack of proper mock state management:
- No centralized mock state reset mechanism
- Tests don't clean up mock state after execution
- Shared mock instances across test methods
- Missing test isolation patterns

SOLUTION:
---------
Implement comprehensive mock state isolation:

1. **Mock State Reset Framework** - Automatic state cleanup
2. **Test Isolation Patterns** - Prevent state contamination
3. **Mock State Validation** - Detect state pollution
4. **Isolated Mock Factories** - Per-test mock instances

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
-------------------

### Step 1: Create Mock State Isolation Framework
File: tests/utils/mock_isolation.py
- MockStateManager class for centralized state management
- automatic_mock_reset decorator for test methods
- MockIsolationTestCase base class with built-in isolation
- validate_mock_isolation() for state contamination detection

### Step 2: Update MockFactory with State Isolation
File: tests/utils/mock_factory.py (enhance existing)
- Add state isolation methods to MockFactory
- Implement per-test-case mock instances
- Add mock state validation and reporting
- Create isolated mock contexts for test execution

### Step 3: Create Mock State Validation Tests
File: tests/unit/utils/test_mock_state_isolation.py
- Test mock state isolation between test cases
- Validate UUID counter isolation
- Test symbol data isolation
- Verify timing sequence isolation

### Step 4: Update Test Files with Isolation Patterns
Convert existing tests to use isolation patterns:
- Add MockIsolationTestCase as base class
- Use automatic_mock_reset decorator
- Implement proper setUp/tearDown with mock state reset
- Add mock state validation to critical tests

FILES TO CREATE/MODIFY:
----------------------
**New Files:**
- tests/utils/mock_isolation.py
- tests/unit/utils/test_mock_state_isolation.py

**Files to Enhance:**
- tests/utils/mock_factory.py (add isolation methods)

**Files to Update:**
- tests/unit/logging/test_trace_id_integration.py
- tests/unit/logging/test_raw_data_logging.py
- tests/unit/test_market_data_service.py
- tests/integration/logging/test_trace_architecture_integration.py

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
----------------------

**Key Isolation Features:**
- Automatic mock state reset between tests
- Per-test mock factory instances
- UUID counter isolation per test case
- Symbol data cache isolation
- Timing sequence isolation

**State Validation:**
- Pre-test state validation
- Post-test state cleanup verification
- Cross-test contamination detection
- Mock state consistency checks

**Isolation Patterns:**
- MockIsolationTestCase base class with automatic cleanup
- @automatic_mock_reset decorator for individual methods
- Context managers for isolated mock execution
- State snapshots for contamination tracking

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
-------------------
✅ Mock state properly isolated between test cases
✅ UUID counters reset for each test
✅ Symbol data isolation prevents cross-contamination
✅ Timing sequences independent per test
✅ Mock state validation catches pollution issues

DEPENDENCIES:
------------
- Requires Task 2.1 (Mock Framework Standardization)
- Enhances Task 2.2 (Log Content Validation Tests)
- Enhances Task 2.3 (Enhanced Assertion Architecture)
- Enables Task 4.1 (Integration Scenario Tests)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-----------------
✅ Tests run in isolation without state contamination
✅ Mock state validation prevents cross-test pollution
✅ All 273 tests pass with isolation framework
✅ Mock state isolation catches issues that previously went undetected
✅ Test execution order doesn't affect test outcomes
