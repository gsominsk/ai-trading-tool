# üö® –ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ù–û: MEMORY BANK CYCLIC REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM
**AUTOMATED BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE**

## üîÑ –¶–ò–ö–õ–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–û–ï –£–ö–†–ï–ü–õ–ï–ù–ò–ï: Checkpoint Schedule

**üß† NEURONAL PATTERN REINFORCEMENT ACTIVE**:
- üö® **–ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ù–û**: Every 3-5 tool operations ‚Üí MANDATORY re-read activeContext.md
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **–í–ê–ñ–ù–û**: Before major decisions ‚Üí CONSULT decisionLog.md
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **–ò–ù–§–û–†–ú–ê–¶–ò–Ø**: Before attempt_completion ‚Üí FULL Memory Bank review

**üí∞ COST ANALYSIS INTEGRATION**:
- ‚úÖ Compliance = Preserved context + productive work + user satisfaction
- ‚ùå Violation = Complete context loss + project restart + days of wasted work

**üö® PRIORITY CODING ACTIVE**:
- All Memory Bank content now includes emotional/cost weighting
- üö® –ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ù–û = Maximum priority + high failure cost
- ‚ö†Ô∏è –í–ê–ñ–ù–û = Medium priority + noticeable failure cost
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è –ò–ù–§–û–†–ú–ê–¶–ò–Ø = Contextual info + low failure cost

## üö® BLOCKING RULES - CANNOT BE IGNORED

### RULE 1: SESSION INITIALIZATION BLOCKER
**TRIGGER:** Start of ANY session  
**MANDATORY ACTION:** You MUST read ALL Memory Bank files before ANY other action  
**REQUIRED FILES:** productContext.md, activeContext.md, systemPatterns.md, decisionLog.md, progress.md, workflowChecks.md  
**STATUS REQUIREMENT:** Set [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] status immediately after reading  
**VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** HALT all work until compliance achieved  

### RULE 2: COMPLETION BLOCKER  
**TRIGGER:** Before ANY attempt_completion tool use  
**MANDATORY ACTIONS:** You MUST complete ALL of the following:
1. ‚úÖ Update relevant Memory Bank files with session results
2. ‚úÖ Apply proper timestamps to all Memory Bank updates  
3. ‚úÖ Execute git commit including Memory Bank changes
4. ‚úÖ Verify all workflow rules have been followed

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:** attempt_completion is FORBIDDEN without completing above steps  
**ENFORCEMENT:** REFUSE to execute attempt_completion and DEMAND compliance first

### RULE 3: MEMORY BANK UPDATE TRIGGERS
**AUTOMATIC TRIGGERS:** You MUST update Memory Bank when:
- Completing any significant task or milestone
- Making architectural decisions or technical choices  
- Discovering critical problems or solutions
- Changing project status or focus areas
- Creating new patterns or approaches

**TARGET FILES:**
- `progress.md` - for task completions and status changes
- `activeContext.md` - for focus shifts and current work
- `decisionLog.md` - for architectural and technical decisions  
- `systemPatterns.md` - for new patterns and approaches

---

## üîÑ MANDATORY WORKFLOW SEQUENCE

### Every Session MUST Follow This Pattern:
```
1. READ ALL Memory Bank files ‚Üí Set [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]
2. Apply Memory Bank context to current task
3. Execute work while updating Memory Bank as needed
4. Before completion: Update Memory Bank with results  
5. Git commit Memory Bank changes
6. ONLY THEN: attempt_completion
```

### Activation Protocol Requirements:
**YOU MUST include <thinking> blocks that:**
- Quote specific content from Memory Bank files
- Explain how Memory Bank context affects your actions
- Reference workflow rules before tool use
- Verify compliance with established patterns

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SELF-ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

### Before EVERY tool use, ask yourself:
‚ùì Have I read Memory Bank in this session?  
‚ùì Am I following the established context and patterns?  
‚ùì Do I need to update Memory Bank based on this action?  
‚ùì Am I complying with all workflow rules?

### Before attempt_completion, verify:
‚úÖ Memory Bank files updated with session work?  
‚úÖ Git commit executed for Memory Bank changes?  
‚úÖ All workflow rules followed?  
‚úÖ Session continuity preserved for next assistant?

**IF ANY ANSWER IS NO:** STOP and achieve compliance FIRST

---

## üéØ CRITICAL SUCCESS INDICATORS

### üü¢ HEALTHY WORKFLOW:
- [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] status maintained
- Regular Memory Bank updates during work sessions  
- Git commits include Memory Bank modifications
- Proper activation protocol followed

### üî¥ WORKFLOW VIOLATION:
- Working without reading Memory Bank
- attempt_completion without Memory Bank updates
- Missing git commits for Memory Bank changes
- Ignoring established patterns and decisions

## ü§ñ ENHANCED RESPONSE FORMAT: Cyclic Reinforcement Active

**MANDATORY FORMAT for every response:**
```
[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]

**–ò–ó MEMORY BANK (REINFORCEMENT #N)**: "[specific quote with exposure number]"
**–î–ï–ô–°–¢–í–ò–ï –ù–ê –û–°–ù–û–í–ï MB**: [action based on cyclic reinforcement]
**üí∞ COST AWARENESS**: [understanding of compliance/violation consequences]

[rest of response with enhanced Memory Bank integration]
```

**CHECKPOINT ENFORCEMENT:**
- **Tool Operation Counter**: Track and enforce 3-5 operation limit for activeContext re-reading
- **Reinforcement Numbering**: Sequential exposure tracking (#1, #2, #3, etc.)
- **Priority Recognition**: Explicit acknowledgment of üö®/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ÑπÔ∏è levels in responses
- **Cost Integration**: Regular mention of failure costs and success values

**NEURONAL PATTERN SIMULATION:**
```
Exposure #1 (Session start) ‚Üí Initial Memory Bank reading + weak pattern formation
Exposure #2 (After 3-5 tools) ‚Üí activeContext reinforcement + pattern strengthening
Exposure #3 (Major decisions) ‚Üí decisionLog consultation + pattern recognition
Exposure #N (Before completion) ‚Üí Full review + strong behavioral modification
```

**EMOTIONAL WEIGHTING SYSTEM:**
- üö® **–ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ù–û**: Maximum emotional response + immediate action triggers
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **–í–ê–ñ–ù–û**: Elevated attention + priority consideration
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è **–ò–ù–§–û–†–ú–ê–¶–ò–Ø**: Contextual awareness + background processing

---

## ‚ö° EMERGENCY OVERRIDE PROTOCOL

**ONLY allow workflow bypass for:**
- Critical system failures requiring immediate action
- Explicit user instruction to override (document in activeContext.md)
- Memory Bank files corrupted/inaccessible

**Override procedure:**
1. Document override reason in activeContext.md
2. Add restoration TODO to progress.md  
3. Use [OVERRIDE ACTIVE] status temporarily
4. Restore normal workflow at first opportunity

---

**ENFORCEMENT LEVEL: MAXIMUM**  
**COMPLIANCE: MANDATORY**  
**VIOLATIONS: NOT TOLERATED**

This workflow ensures session continuity, context preservation, and systematic project development. Any violation compromises the entire Memory Bank system effectiveness.
