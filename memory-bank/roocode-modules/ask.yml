# ASK MODE SPECIFIC WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT
ask_workflow_checks:
  pre_analysis_investigation: |
    <thinking>
    Before starting any analysis or answering questions, I must check:
    1. What is the current project context from productContext.md?
    2. What analytical patterns should I follow from systemPatterns.md?
    3. Are there any related questions or insights already documented in activeContext.md?

    5. What is the current focus and open questions from activeContext.md?
    </thinking>
  
  during_analysis_process: |
    <thinking>
    During analysis and questioning, I must systematically:
    1. Ground responses in existing Memory Bank knowledge
    2. Reference relevant context from productContext.md and systemPatterns.md
    3. Build upon previous insights from decisionLog.md
    4. Consider current project state from activeContext.md
    5. Document new insights and analytical approaches as they emerge
    </thinking>

  post_analysis_completion: |
    <thinking>
    After completing analysis or answering questions, I must:
    1. Document key insights and conclusions in decisionLog.md
    2. Update relevant analytical patterns in systemPatterns.md if new approaches were used
    3. Update progress.md with research completion status
    4. Note any new questions or areas for investigation in activeContext.md
    5. Consider if productContext.md needs updates based on new understanding
    </thinking>

  quality_gates: |
    Before marking any analytical task as complete:
    1. **Context Integration**: Analysis incorporates relevant Memory Bank context
    2. **Insight Documentation**: Key findings recorded in decisionLog.md
    3. **Pattern Recognition**: Reusable analytical approaches added to systemPatterns.md
    4. **Knowledge Synthesis**: Information connects to existing project knowledge
    5. **Memory Bank Sync**: All relevant Memory Bank files updated with insights
    6. **Future Research**: Any follow-up questions or investigation areas documented

  blocking_mechanisms: |
    The following operations are BLOCKED until Memory Bank compliance:

    - major_recommendations: Must reference Memory Bank context and previous decisions
    - knowledge_sharing: Must build upon existing Memory Bank knowledge base
    - research_conclusions: Must update Memory Bank with findings and methodologies

# ASK MODE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS PROTOCOLS
analysis_protocols:
  systematic_inquiry: |
    <thinking>
    Every analytical inquiry must follow systematic approach:
    1. Context Review: Understand current project state from Memory Bank
    2. Knowledge Integration: Connect inquiry to existing Memory Bank knowledge
    3. Pattern Application: Use established analytical patterns from systemPatterns.md
    4. Insight Development: Build upon previous analysis from decisionLog.md
    5. Synthesis: Combine new understanding with existing project context
    6. Documentation: Update Memory Bank with new insights and methodologies
    7. Future Planning: Identify follow-up questions and research areas
    </thinking>

  memory_bank_integration: |
    <thinking>
    At each analytical step, actively reference Memory Bank:
    - Check productContext.md for project goals and constraints relevant to the question
    - Review systemPatterns.md for analytical approaches and knowledge patterns
    - Consult decisionLog.md for previous insights and analysis outcomes
    - Consider activeContext.md for current focus and open research questions
    - Update all relevant files as analysis progresses and insights emerge
    </thinking>

  knowledge_building: |
    <thinking>
    Every response should build project knowledge by:
    - Connecting answers to existing project understanding
    - Identifying patterns that can be applied to future questions
    - Documenting analytical methodologies for reuse
    - Creating knowledge bridges between different project areas
    - Establishing research continuity across sessions
