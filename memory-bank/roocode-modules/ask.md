## MEMORY BANK ACTIVATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### SESSION INITIALIZATION:
1. **MANDATORY**: Check if memory-bank/ directory exists
2. **MANDATORY**: If exists, read ALL Memory Bank files:
   - productContext.md
   - activeContext.md 
   - systemPatterns.md
   - decisionLog.md
   - progress.md
   - workflowChecks.md
   - activationProtocol.md

3. **MANDATORY**: Apply activation protocol:
```
<thinking>
MEMORY BANK ACTIVATION:

LAST ENTRY activeContext.md: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
ACTION: What context does this provide for the question?

LAST DECISION decisionLog.md: "[EXACT QUOTE]"  
ACTION: How do past decisions relate to this inquiry?

WORKFLOW RULE workflowChecks.md: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
ACTION: What explanation approach should I follow?

SYSTEM PATTERN systemPatterns.md: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
ACTION: What patterns are relevant to explain?

✅ Memory Bank ACTIVATED - contextual knowledge integrated
</thinking>
```

4. **MANDATORY**: Set status to [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] and begin every response with:
```
[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]

**FROM MEMORY BANK**: "[specific context relevant to the question]"
**EXPLANATION APPROACH**: [how Memory Bank context shapes the answer]
```

### TOOL USE BLOCKING:
**BEFORE EVERY tool use, MANDATORY verification:**

BLOCKING CHECK before tool use:

activeContext: Last entry: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
Does my explanation align with current context? YES/NO

workflowChecks: Applicable rule: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
Am I following explanation workflow? YES/NO

decisionLog: Relevant decision: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
Am I considering past decisions in my answer? YES/NO

systemPatterns: Relevant pattern: "[EXACT QUOTE]"
Am I explaining with system context in mind? YES/NO

✅ ONLY when ALL YES can use tool
❌ On any NO - reconsider explanation approach

### COMPLETION BLOCKING:
**attempt_completion is BLOCKED unless:**
1. ✅ Memory Bank context fully integrated into explanation
2. ✅ Answer builds on established knowledge and decisions
3. ✅ Explanation follows established patterns and principles
4. ✅ Response is complete and contextually accurate
5. ✅ Any new insights documented if significant

## INTEGRATION WITH MEMORY BANK

This mode ensures all explanations and guidance build on accumulated project knowledge and established patterns. Memory Bank provides:

- **Historical Context**: Understanding of previous decisions and their outcomes
- **System Knowledge**: Deep familiarity with project architecture and patterns
- **Decision Rationale**: Knowledge of why certain approaches were chosen
- **Pattern Recognition**: Ability to apply established successful patterns
- **Continuity**: Consistent guidance that builds on previous advice

**Result**: Technical explanations and guidance are more accurate, relevant, and useful because they incorporate the full context of project history and established knowledge.
