Complete project history (928 lines before this optimization) is archived in [`memory-bank/archive/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/archive/activeContext.md). The full, unabridged history is preserved there.

## Current Focus
[2025-08-11 01:29:00] - **Current Focus: Test Fixing (Wave 5)**. Continuing the systematic process of fixing tests broken by the `BinanceApiClient` refactoring. The primary issue is an outdated mocking strategy (`patch('requests.get')`) that needs to be replaced with configuration of the mock `BinanceApiClient`. Having fixed `test_market_data_integration.py` and `test_comprehensive_integration.py`, the current focus is on applying the same fix to `tests/unit/logging/test_http_filter.py`.
[2025-08-11 01:16:00] - **Current Focus: Correcting Flawed Logic**. The immediate task is to revert an incorrect "graceful degradation" implementation in `MarketDataService`. This faulty logic was suppressing a `DataInsufficientError`, causing a test to fail because it correctly expected an exception. The plan is to remove the fallback mechanism and restore the test to validate the "fail-fast" behavior, aligning the code with the original design principles.
**üöÄ MILESTONE: Codebase Modernization & Full Test Suite Pass**
- **`utcnow()` Deprecation Fixed**: Systematically replaced all deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` calls with the timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` across the entire codebase (`src` and `tests`).
- **Test Suite Stabilized**: Fixed all resulting test failures, including missing dependencies (`jsonschema`, `psutil`) and incorrect assertions related to timestamp formats and JSON schemas.
- **100% PASS RATE ACHIEVED**: The entire test suite (23 files) now passes with zero failures and zero warnings.
- **Current Status**: The codebase is fully stabilized, modernized, and ready for the next phase of development.

## Recent Changes (Last 10 Entries)
[2025-08-09 23:22:00] - **ARCHITECTURAL MILESTONE: Comprehensive Documentation Complete**: The primary architectural document, `docs/architecture/project_structure.txt`, has been finalized. It now includes a detailed breakdown of each component's responsibilities and an enhanced block diagram that clearly illustrates the system's decoupled nature. This marks the completion of the architectural definition phase.

[2025-08-09 23:15:00] - **ARCHITECTURAL MILESTONE: System Diagram Finalized**: Completed a critical iterative process of refining the system's architectural diagram in `docs/architecture/project_structure.txt`. The final version accurately reflects the simplified persistence model, which includes the removal of the redundant `TradeLogRepository` and the decision to use CSV for the `OMSRepository`. This resolves all previous logical inconsistencies and establishes a clear, final blueprint for the system's data flow.

[2025-08-09 22:09:00] - **MILESTONE: Codebase Modernization & Stabilization Complete**: Finished a comprehensive refactoring to replace all deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` calls with the modern `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. This eliminated hundreds of `DeprecationWarning`s. All associated test failures were fixed, including missing dependencies (`jsonschema`, `psutil`) and incorrect test assertions. The entire test suite of 23 files now passes with zero failures and zero warnings, indicating a fully stable and modernized codebase.
[2025-08-09 22:04:00] - **Codebase Refactoring & Test Environment Fix**: Completed a major refactoring of repository filenames and fixed the test execution environment. All tests are now passing.
[2025-08-09 00:01:00] - **Architectural Refactoring: Hierarchical Tracing**: Refactored the logging system to support hierarchical tracing. This involved simplifying `TraceGenerator` to produce a single `trace_id` and updating `MarketDataService` to propagate this `trace_id` as a `parent_trace_id` to all sub-operations. This change provides a clear parent-child relationship in logs, significantly improving debuggability and system observability. All related tests were updated or created, and the entire test suite is now passing.

[2025-08-08 22:52:00] - **MILESTONE: Phase 4 (TradingCycle Refactoring) Completed**

[2025-08-06 23:31:27] - Current Focus: Finalized the detailed plan for Phase 3 (OMS Persistence Refactoring).

[2025-08-06 21:10:00] - **MEMORY BANK OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED**
- **Context**: Performed a full optimization of the Memory Bank according to the `optimizationGuide.md`.
- **Key Achievements**:
    - Reduced the total size of active Memory Bank files from 3772 to 1432 lines (a 62% reduction).
    - Archived the full history of `decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`, and `activeContext.md` to preserve 100% of the project's context.
    - Updated `optimizationGuide.md` with a new rule to exclude `systemPatterns.md` from future optimizations, as requested.
- **Outcome**: The Memory Bank is now significantly more efficient, reducing token consumption and improving performance, while ensuring all historical data remains accessible in the archive.

[2025-08-10 00:01:30] - **Recent Changes**: Completed Phase 6 "Architectural Alignment".
- Fixed a persistent `AttributeError` in `trading_cycle.py` by adopting the correct semantic logging pattern (`log_operation_start`) instead of attempting workarounds.
- Discovered that the main test runner (`run_all_tests.py`) was not executing all tests, specifically ignoring the `tests/archive` directory and one uncategorized unit test (`tests/unit/logging/test_trace_generator.py`).
- Connected the missing unit test to the test runner.
- Successfully executed the complete, connected test suite (excluding archives), confirming the bug fix and system stability.
**Current Focus**: Finalizing Phase 6 by updating task status.

[2025-08-10 00:14:30] - **Status Update**: Phase 6 (Architectural Alignment) is complete. All associated tasks, including bug fixes and test suite corrections, have been finalized.
**Current Focus**: Starting **Phase 7: OmsRepository Migration to SQLite**. The detailed plan has been created and approved. Proceeding with implementation.

[2025-08-10 00:33:25] - **Current Focus:** Shifted from completing the SQLite migration to fixing a critical bug in the trading cycle logic identified by the user. The bug caused the cycle to terminate prematurely.
