# Active Context

## Archive Reference
Complete project history (928 lines before this optimization) is archived in [`memory-bank/archive/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/archive/activeContext.md). The full, unabridged history is preserved there.

## Current Focus
**üöÄ PHASE 4 COMPLETE: TradingCycle Refactoring**
- The `TradingCycle` has been refactored to use the Repository Pattern for handling the trade log, decoupling it from direct file I/O.
- All `print()` statements have been replaced with structured logging using `MarketDataLogger`.
- Error handling has been improved by replacing generic `except Exception` blocks with specific ones (`MarketDataError`).
- All unit and integration tests (288 total) are passing, confirming the stability of the new architecture.

## Recent Changes (Last 10 Entries)
[2025-08-09 00:01:00] - **Architectural Refactoring: Hierarchical Tracing**: Refactored the logging system to support hierarchical tracing. This involved simplifying `TraceGenerator` to produce a single `trace_id` and updating `MarketDataService` to propagate this `trace_id` as a `parent_trace_id` to all sub-operations. This change provides a clear parent-child relationship in logs, significantly improving debuggability and system observability. All related tests were updated or created, and the entire test suite is now passing.

[2025-08-08 22:52:00] - **MILESTONE: Phase 4 (TradingCycle Refactoring) Completed**

[2025-08-06 23:31:27] - Current Focus: Finalized the detailed plan for Phase 3 (OMS Persistence Refactoring).

[2025-08-06 21:10:00] - **MEMORY BANK OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED**
- **Context**: Performed a full optimization of the Memory Bank according to the `optimizationGuide.md`.
- **Key Achievements**:
    - Reduced the total size of active Memory Bank files from 3772 to 1432 lines (a 62% reduction).
    - Archived the full history of `decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`, and `activeContext.md` to preserve 100% of the project's context.
    - Updated `optimizationGuide.md` with a new rule to exclude `systemPatterns.md` from future optimizations, as requested.
- **Outcome**: The Memory Bank is now significantly more efficient, reducing token consumption and improving performance, while ensuring all historical data remains accessible in the archive.
