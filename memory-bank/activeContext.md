# Active Context

## Archive Reference
Complete project history (approx. 120 lines) is archived in [`memory-bank/archive/20250811T231859Z/activeContext.md`](memory-bank/archive/20250811T231859Z/activeContext.md). The full, unabridged history is preserved there.

## Current Focus
[2025-08-11 23:18:59] - **Current Focus: Memory Bank Optimization**. Following the successful fix of the `optimizemb` command, the current task is to execute it. The process involves archiving the current state of the memory bank files into a timestamped directory and then optimizing each file by reducing it to the last 10 entries plus a historical index.

## Recent Changes (Last 10 Entries)
[2025-08-11 23:22:27] - **Memory Bank Optimization Complete**: Successfully executed the `optimizemb` command. The active context files were reduced to a total of 1461 lines, with full history preserved in the `memory-bank/archive/20250811T231859Z/` directory. The process is complete and the system is ready for the next task.
