## Recent Decisions (Last 10 Entries)
[2025-08-13 00:22:00] - **Logging Improvement: Added Completion Log to OMS**. Based on a detailed log review, it was identified that the `OrderManagementSystem.place_order` method was missing a log entry upon successful completion.
    - **Problem**: The operational flow showed a `place_order initiated` log, but no corresponding `completed` log, creating ambiguity about whether the operation finished successfully before the subsequent `repo_save` operation began.
    - **Solution**: A `self.logger.log_operation_complete(...)` call was added to the end of the `place_order` method.
    - **Impact**: This enhances system observability by providing a clear, explicit confirmation in the logs that the order placement logic has completed successfully, improving traceability and making debugging easier.

[2025-08-13 00:16:00] - **Architectural Decision: Decouple Data Serialization for Logging and LLM**. To resolve a critical logging issue where nested JSON was being rendered as an escaped string, the `MarketDataSet` class was refactored.
    - **Problem**: The logger was receiving a pre-serialized JSON string, causing incorrect formatting and making structured log analysis impossible.
    - **Solution**: The original `to_json_context` method was split into two:
        1. `to_context_dict() -> dict`: Returns a raw Python dictionary, intended for structured loggers.
        2. `to_json_context() -> str`: A simple wrapper that calls the above method and dumps the result to a compact JSON string, ensuring backward compatibility for consumers like the LLM client.
    - **Impact**: This change ensures that logs are correctly formatted with native JSON objects, enabling proper parsing, querying, and analysis, while preserving the required string format for the LLM prompt. This is a crucial fix for system observability and maintainability.

[2025-08-13 00:01:00] - **Architectural Decision: Adopt "Fail-Fast" for Enhanced Context Analysis**. Based on a requirement for absolute data integrity, the `get_enhanced_context` method was refactored from a "graceful degradation" model to a strict "Fail-Fast" policy. Any failure within the internal analysis pipeline (e.g., trend, pattern, or volume analysis) will now immediately raise a `ProcessingError`, halting the operation instead of returning a partial result. This ensures that the LLM never receives incomplete or potentially misleading analysis, prioritizing data reliability over operational continuity in this specific context.

[2025-08-13 00:01:00] - **Architectural Decision: Switch LLM Context from String to Structured JSON**. The core data-passing mechanism to the LLM was refactored from a verbose, custom-formatted string to a structured JSON format via a new `to_json_context()` method in the `MarketDataSet` dataclass.
    - **Rationale**: The previous string format was inefficient for LLM parsing, brittle to changes in the data structure, and prone to formatting errors. The new JSON format is robust, machine-readable, easily extensible, and significantly more token-efficient.
    - **Impact**: This fundamental change improves system reliability, reduces LLM processing overhead, and simplifies debugging and future development. All relevant tests were updated to validate the new JSON output, and a "Fail-Fast" error handling policy was enforced to guarantee data integrity.

[2025-08-10 22:10:00] - **Architectural Decision: Stricter Workflow for Refactoring**. Added a mandatory testing policy to `workflowChecks.md`. Any change to existing code (refactoring, bug fix) must be immediately followed by a full test suite run within the same phase to ensure no regressions are introduced. This enforces a higher standard of quality and prevents breaking changes from being committed.


[2025-08-10 22:20:00] - **Architectural Decision: Make `service_name` a Mandatory Parameter in Logging System**. To fix incorrect service attribution in logs, the `service_name` parameter was made mandatory across the entire logging chain (`AIOptimizedJSONFormatter`, `StructuredLogger`, `get_logger`, `MarketDataLogger`). This forces each component to explicitly declare its identity when creating a logger, eliminating the risk of incorrect, hardcoded default values. A subsequent test run confirmed this change by producing widespread `TypeError` failures, precisely identifying all call sites that require updates.

[2025-08-10 20:45:00] - Refactored core logging system to support dynamic `service_name`.
    - **Decision:** Modified `AIOptimizedJSONFormatter` to extract `service_name` from the `LogRecord` instead of being initialized with a hardcoded value. `StructuredLogger` now acts as an adapter to inject the `service_name` into each log record's `extra` dictionary. The logging configuration (`LoggerConfig`) was also updated to manage its handlers without interfering with `pytest`'s capture mechanism.
    - **Rationale:** The previous implementation hardcoded `"service":"MarketDataService"` in the formatter, causing all logs to be incorrectly attributed. The new architecture decouples the formatter from specific services, allowing each component to correctly identify itself. The fix for the test interference ensures a stable and isolated testing environment.
    - **Implication:** All logger instantiations throughout the codebase must now provide a `service_name`. Unit tests for logging required significant refactoring.

[2025-08-10 21:20:15] - [Test Refactoring] - Refactored `tests/integration/logging/test_end_to_end_tracing.py` to use the real `AIOptimizedJSONFormatter` and validate the `service` field in the JSON logs. This ensures the test correctly verifies the dynamic service name injection, which was the primary goal of the logging refactoring. The previous implementation used a custom formatter that completely ignored the `service` field, rendering the test ineffective for its intended purpose.

### [2025-08-10 21:51:37] - **Decision: Increase Kline Data Fetch Limit for MA50 Calculation**
**Problem**: Log analysis revealed that the `MarketDataService` was consistently using a fallback mechanism to calculate the 50-period Moving Average (MA50). The service was fetching only 48 hours of 1-hour kline data, which was insufficient for a 50-period calculation, leading to a less accurate technical indicator.
**Solution**: The `limit` parameter in the `_get_klines` call within `market_data_service.py` was increased from 48 to 100 for the 1-hour interval.
**Rationale**: This simple change ensures that the service always has more than enough data (100 points) to perform a standard 50-period MA calculation. It eliminates the reliance on the graceful degradation logic, thereby improving the quality and reliability of the technical analysis data used for AI decision-making. The change was determined to have no impact on existing tests.
**Result**: The system now produces a more accurate MA50 indicator. The fix was validated through a full test suite run and a real-world scenario execution, confirming the fallback is no longer triggered.

### [2025-08-11 22:24:00] - **Decision: Remove Obsolete Test from Test Suite**
**Problem**: The test suite contained a skipped test, `test_logging_integration_handles_logger_failure`, in `tests/unit/logging/test_logging_components.py`. This test was marked as obsolete because the underlying logic it was designed to validate (logger initialization within a service) was removed during a previous architectural refactoring that introduced dependency injection.
**Solution**: The obsolete test was permanently deleted from the test file.
**Rationale**: Leaving skipped, obsolete tests in the codebase creates "noise" and can lead to confusion for developers. It is better to remove them entirely to maintain a clean and relevant test suite. The functionality it once tested is now covered by other, more appropriate exception handling tests.
**Result**: The test suite is cleaner and more maintainable. The removal was validated by a full test run, which confirmed that no regressions were introduced.

### [2025-08-11 22:27:00] - **Decision: Modernize Datetime Calls to Eliminate Deprecation Warnings**
**Problem**: The test suite was generating multiple `DeprecationWarning`s because `tests/unit/trading/test_oms_repository_sqlite.py` used the `datetime.utcnow()` method, which is deprecated. These warnings cluttered the test output and signaled the use of outdated practices.
**Solution**: All instances of `datetime.utcnow()` were replaced with the modern, timezone-aware equivalent: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`. The necessary `timezone` object was imported from the `datetime` module.
**Rationale**: Using up-to-date, non-deprecated methods is crucial for long-term code health and maintainability. This change ensures the codebase is aligned with current Python best practices and will be compatible with future versions.
**Result**: The test suite now runs cleanly without any `DeprecationWarning`s, improving readability and confidence in the test results.

### [2025-08-11 22:31:00] - **Decision: Clean Up Test Runner Configuration**
**Problem**: The universal test runner (`tests/run_all_tests.py`) was configured to run two test files that no longer exist in the project: `tests/unit/test_timing_validation.py` and `tests/integration/logging/test_hierarchical_tracing.py`. This resulted in unnecessary and confusing "Skipping missing test" warnings in the test output.
**Solution**: The references to these two non-existent files were removed from the `test_categories` dictionary within the `AITradingTestRunner` class.
**Rationale**: A clean test execution output is crucial for developer confidence. Removing references to deleted files ensures that the test runner's output is concise, accurate, and free of irrelevant warnings, allowing developers to focus on actual test results.
**Result**: The test suite now runs without any warnings about missing files, providing a cleaner and more professional development experience.

### [2025-08-11 22:08:00] - **Architectural Decision: Refactor `BinanceApiClient` to Use `StructuredLogger`**
**Problem**: The `BinanceApiClient` was using Python's standard `logging.Logger`. This resulted in logs that lacked critical context, appearing with `"service": "default_service"` and `"operation": "unknown"`. This broke the unified logging schema and made it difficult to trace the origin and purpose of API-related log entries.
**Solution**: The `BinanceApiClient` will be refactored to accept and use the project's custom `StructuredLogger`.
1.  The `__init__` method will be updated to require a `StructuredLogger` instance.
2.  All logging calls (`.info()`, `.error()`, etc.) will be replaced with the structured equivalents, passing key information like `operation`, `context`, and `trace_id` as explicit parameters.
**Result**: This change will ensure that all logs originating from the `BinanceApiClient` are fully structured and conform to the project's logging standards. It will provide complete context, including the service name and operation, making the entire system's behavior more transparent and easier to debug.

### [2025-08-11 14:23:00] - **Architectural Decision: Complete Test Suite Refactoring for `MarketDataService`**
**Problem**: A major architectural refactoring to introduce a `BinanceApiClient` and a dedicated infrastructure layer had broken the entire unit test suite for `MarketDataService`. The tests were using an outdated strategy of mocking the low-level `requests` library, which was no longer directly used by the service. This resulted in a cascade of `DataInsufficientError` and `AttributeError` failures, rendering the tests useless.
**Solution**: A systematic, multi-wave refactoring of all affected unit tests (`test_market_data_api.py`, `test_market_data_core.py`, `test_market_data_edge_cases.py`) was executed.
1.  **Standardized Mocking**: All tests were updated to mock the `api_client.get_klines` method, which is the correct point of interaction after the refactoring.
2.  **Correct Exception Handling**: Tests were updated to assert for the correct, high-level exceptions (`ProcessingError`, `NetworkError`, etc.) that are now raised by the service, instead of low-level `requests` exceptions.
3.  **Removal of Private Method Tests**: Tests that directly targeted private methods were removed in favor of testing the same logic through the public `get_market_data` interface, making the tests more robust and less brittle.
**Result**: The entire unit test suite for `MarketDataService` is now fully aligned with the new, decoupled architecture. The tests are more reliable, easier to maintain, and correctly validate the service's contract. All 239 tests in the project now pass, confirming the stability of the system after the major architectural overhaul.

[2025-08-13 19:43:31] - Implemented a time-based in-memory cache for BTC data to optimize correlation calculations. Added a new `log_cache_event` method to `MarketDataLogger` for semantic logging of cache events, avoiding the use of a generic `.info()` method and maintaining the logger's specialized interface.
