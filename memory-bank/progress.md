[2025-08-10 00:33:33] - **Fix:** Corrected a critical logic flaw in `trading_cycle.py` that caused premature cycle termination. The fix ensures the trading loop continues after order status synchronization, enabling proper AI decision-making.

[2025-08-10 16:04:47] - **Phase 8, Tasks 8.1-8.2**: Created unit tests for `sqlite3.OperationalError` and `sqlite3.IntegrityError` in `OmsRepository`. The tests currently pass, confirming that the repository correctly propagates raw database exceptions. This sets the stage for the next step, where these raw exceptions will be wrapped in a custom `RepositoryError`.

[2025-08-10 16:05:35] - **Phase 8, Tasks 8.4-8.5**: Created a unit test for handling corrupted database files and defined the new `RepositoryError` exception class in `src/market_data/exceptions.py`. This completes the first block of TDD work.

[2025-08-10 16:08:36] - **Phase 8, Tasks 8.7-8.8**: Refactored `OmsRepository` to wrap `sqlite3.Error` in the custom `RepositoryError` and injected the `MarketDataLogger` into its constructor. This prepares the repository for semantic logging.

[2025-08-10 16:09:40] - **Phase 8, Tasks 8.10-8.11**: Completed the first stage of logging integration. All `print` statements in `OmsRepository` were removed during prior refactoring, and the `MarketDataLogger` has been successfully injected into `OrderManagementSystem` to enable trace_id propagation.

[2025-08-10 16:11:23] - **Phase 8, Tasks 8.13-8.14**: Implemented robust exception handling in `OrderManagementSystem` to catch `RepositoryError` and prevent crashes. Ran the full test suite (23 files), which passed successfully, confirming the stability of all changes made during Phase 8.

[2025-08-10 16:31:32] - **Фаза 9: Начало работ по сквозной трассировке**.
- **Задача 9.1**: `MarketDataService.get_market_data` успешно отрефакторен для приема `parent_trace_id`.
- **Задача 9.2**: `TradingCycle.run_cycle` теперь генерирует мастер `trace_id` для каждой операции.
- **Задача 9.3**: Интеграция между `TradingCycle` и `MarketDataService` завершена, `trace_id` передается корректно.

[2025-08-10 16:34:54] - Phase 9: End-to-End Tracing. Completed tasks 9.5 through 9.9.
  - **9.5 & 9.6**: `OmsRepository` methods (`load`, `save`, `delete`) updated to accept `trace_id` and implement detailed logging.
  - **9.7 & 9.8**: `OrderManagementSystem` methods refactored to accept and propagate `trace_id` to the repository layer.
  - **9.9**: `TradingCycle` updated to pass the master `trace_id` to all `OMS` method calls.
  - **Status**: The full data and logic chain from `TradingCycle` -> `OMS` -> `OmsRepository` is now instrumented for end-to-end tracing.

[2025-08-10 17:13:42] - Task 9.12 (Run all tests) failed due to `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: orders` in `test_end_to_end_tracing.py`. The root cause was identified as the ephemeral nature of `:memory:` database connections. Began refactoring `OmsRepository` to use a persistent connection for in-memory databases during tests.


[2025-08-10 20:50:37] - **Phase 9.1, Phase 1 COMPLETE**: Successfully refactored `MarketDataService` to simplify tracing logic. Removed the internal `trace_id` generation (`_start_operation`) and updated all methods to accept a single, externally-provided `trace_id`. This simplifies the code and sets the foundation for fixing the end-to-end tracing test.


[2025-08-10 20:52:03] - **Phase 9.1, Phase 2 COMPLETE**: Refactored `TradingCycle` to align with the new simplified tracing logic. The call to `market_data_service.get_market_data` now correctly passes the `master_trace_id` to the `trace_id` parameter, ensuring a single trace ID is used for the entire operation.

[2025-08-10 17:53:50] - [Phase 3: Integration Test Refactoring] Completed refactoring of `tests/integration/logging/test_end_to_end_tracing.py`. The test now uses a simplified assertion model to verify the propagation of a single `master_trace_id`, aligning with the new tracing logic.

[2025-08-10 18:46:22] - Phase 9.1 (Tracing Simplification) is complete. All tests are passing after refactoring the `MarketDataService` to use a single `trace_id` and enforcing its presence. The system is now more robust and easier to debug.


[2025-08-10 22:10:00] - **Workflow Improvement**: Updated `workflowChecks.md` with a strict policy requiring a full test suite run immediately after any code refactoring or modification. This ensures all changes are validated against regressions before proceeding.


[2025-08-10 22:20:00] - **Logging Refactoring, Phase 1.3**: Completed core logging refactoring by making `service_name` a mandatory parameter. Ran the full test suite, which failed as expected with `TypeError`, successfully identifying all components that require updates.


[2025-08-10 23:02:00] - **Logging Refactoring, Phase 2.4**: Completed updates to all core service components (`TradingCycle`, `OMS`, `OmsRepository`, `MarketDataService`) to provide the new mandatory `service_name` parameter during logger initialization. The main application logic is now aligned with the new logging contract.

[2025-08-10 20:45:14] - **Phase 1: Core Logging Refactoring COMPLETE**
    - Successfully refactored the core logging system (`json_formatter.py`, `logger_config.py`) to support dynamic service names.
    - Adapted and fixed all associated unit tests in `tests/unit/logging/test_core_logging.py`.
    - All tests for this phase are passing.

[2025-08-10 20:59:51] - [Phase 2] Начато исправление тестов после обновления компонентов. Основная проблема связана с некорректным перехватом логов фикстурой `capfd`.

[2025-08-10 21:18:59] - [Phase 2: Component and Test Updates] - Completed. All components updated to provide `service_name` to the logger. All 255 tests are passing after significant refactoring to use `caplog` and fix subprocess test issues.

[2025-08-10 21:20:25] - [Phase 3: Test Validation] - Completed. Refactored `tests/integration/logging/test_end_to_end_tracing.py` to correctly validate `service_name` propagation. All 255 tests are confirmed to be passing, ensuring the new logging architecture is robust and fully tested.

[2025-08-10 21:21:28] - [Project Completion] - The logging refactoring project is complete. All phases, from core refactoring to component updates, test fixing, and final validation, have been successfully executed. The system now correctly logs dynamic service names, and all 255 tests are passing, confirming the stability and correctness of the new architecture.

[2025-08-10 21:51:55] - **Fix: MA50 Calculation Reliability**. Resolved an issue where `MarketDataService` fetched insufficient data for the 50-period Moving Average, causing it to rely on a fallback mechanism. The kline fetch limit was increased from 48 to 100, ensuring the calculation is always performed on a full dataset. The fix was validated with a full test suite run and a real-world scenario, confirming the system's accuracy and reliability have been improved.

[2025-08-11 00:10:00] - **Refactoring: API Client Infrastructure (Phase 2 Complete)**. Successfully migrated the exception hierarchy from `src/market_data` to the new, more generic `src/infrastructure` layer. The base exception class was renamed to `ApiClientError` to better reflect its broader scope. The old exceptions file has been deleted. This completes the foundational work for creating a decoupled API client.

[2025-08-11 00:12:00] - **Refactoring: API Client Infrastructure (Phase 3 Complete)**. The skeleton for the new `BinanceApiClient` has been successfully implemented. This includes the basic `__init__` structure, a centralized `_handle_response` method for robust error handling, and `NotImplementedError` stubs for future order management methods. The client is now ready for the implementation of public-facing methods.
