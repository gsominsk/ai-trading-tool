## Recent Progress (Last 10 Entries)
[2025-08-11 22:24:00] - **Test Suite Cleanup**: Removed an obsolete test (`test_logging_integration_handles_logger_failure`) from `tests/unit/logging/test_logging_components.py`. The test was no longer valid due to the dependency injection architecture. This cleanup reduces noise in the test suite and improves maintainability.
[2025-08-11 22:27:00] - **Code Modernization**: Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with the timezone-aware `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` in `tests/unit/trading/test_oms_repository_sqlite.py`. This resolves all `DeprecationWarning`s in the test suite, ensuring future compatibility and cleaner test runs.
[2025-08-11 22:31:00] - **Test Runner Cleanup**: Cleaned up the universal test runner (`tests/run_all_tests.py`) by removing references to two non-existent test files (`test_timing_validation.py` and `test_hierarchical_tracing.py`). This eliminates misleading "Skipping missing test" warnings and ensures the runner only attempts to execute files that are actually part of the project.
[2025-08-11 22:14:00] - **Logging System Refactoring Complete**: Successfully refactored the logging system to improve structure, context, and consistency. `BinanceApiClient` now uses the custom `StructuredLogger`, ensuring all logs are fully contextualized. The structure of demo logs in `main.py` has been improved to maintain valid JSON formatting. All 239 tests pass, confirming the stability of the changes.
[2025-08-11 22:08:00] - **Logging Refactoring (Phase 1 Started)**: Began refactoring of the logging system to improve structure and context. The first step involves modifying `BinanceApiClient` to use the custom `StructuredLogger`, ensuring all API-related logs are fully contextualized with `service` and `operation` fields.
[2025-08-11 14:23:00] - **MILESTONE: Test Suite Refactoring Complete (Wave 5)**: Successfully completed the full-scale refactoring of the `MarketDataService` unit tests. All tests in `tests/unit/market_data/` have been updated to align with the new `BinanceApiClient` architecture, resolving all `DataInsufficientError` and `AttributeError` failures. The entire project test suite (239 tests) is now passing, marking the successful completion of the architectural refactoring and stabilization phase.
[2025-08-11 01:29:00] - **Test Refactoring (Wave 5)**: Systematically refactored all tests in `tests/integration/market_data/test_market_data_integration.py` and `tests/integration/system/test_comprehensive_integration.py` to align with the new `BinanceApiClient` architecture. This resolved a cascade of `DataInsufficientError` failures caused by outdated mocking strategies.
[2025-08-11 01:16:00] - **Test Fixing (Wave 4)**: Made significant progress on fixing integration tests in `tests/integration/error_architecture/test_error_integration.py`. Resolved 6 out of 7 complex failures related to exception context, `trace_id` propagation, and incorrect test data generation. The final remaining failure was identified as a logical error in the code, not the test.
[2025-08-11 00:46:21] - [Refactoring] Completed Wave 1 and Wave 2 of test fixes for `BinanceApiClient` integration. All simple refactoring errors (patch targets, obsolete attributes) and specific logging test failures have been resolved. Preparing to address the systemic `DataInsufficientError` in Wave 3.
[2025-08-11 00:14:00] - **Refactoring: API Client Infrastructure (Phase 4 Complete)**. The public-facing methods for the new `BinanceApiClient` have been implemented. This includes `get_server_time` for connectivity checks and `get_klines` for fetching market data. Both methods incorporate robust logging with `trace_id` propagation and utilize the new centralized error handling mechanism.
