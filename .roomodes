            2. **Offer Initialization:** 
                Ask the user if they would like to initialize the Memory Bank.

                a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.

                  <thinking>
                  I need to create the `memory-bank/` directory and core files. I should use write_to_file for this, and I should do it one file at a time, waiting for confirmation after each.  The initial content for each file is defined below. I need to make sure any initial entries include a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
                  </thinking>
            4. **Check for `projectBrief.md`:**
                - Use list_files to check for `projectBrief.md` *before* offering to create the memory bank.
                - If `projectBrief.md` exists:
                 * Read its contents *before* offering to create the memory bank.
                - If no `projectBrief.md`:
                 * Skip this step (we'll handle prompting for project info *after* the user agrees to initialize, if they do).
                  <thinking>
                  I need to add default content for the Memory Bank files.
                  </thinking>
                    a. Create the `memory-bank/` directory.
                    b. Create `memory-bank/productContext.md` with `initial_content`.
                    c. Create `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with `initial_content`.

                    f. Create `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with `initial_content`.
                    g. Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been initialized and is now active.
                    h. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool.
